The helper class for Laravel 4 applications to get active class base on current route. I was inspired from [dwightwatson/active](https://github.com/dwightwatson/active).

## Installation

Add this package to your `composer.json` file and run `composer update` once.

```
"hieu-le/active": "~1.0"
```

If you use this package in Laravel, the most suitable version will be selected base on the version of Laravel package.

Append this line to your `providers` array

```php
'HieuLe\Active\ActiveServiceProvider',
```

Append this line to your `aliases` array

```php
'Active' => 'HieuLe\Active\Facades\Active',
```

### Changes in version 1.2
Support new method `Active::routePattern`. This method will check the current **route name** with an array of patterns instead of an array of route names.
